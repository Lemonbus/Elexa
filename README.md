# Elexa

This is part of a batch of projects I made available to the public because they are no longer in active development, and/or are too unfinished or broken to be considered useful to me.

Elexa has the most potential out of these projects, since it's still a project I consider working on from time to time. I essentially wanted a report system that used tickets and used a more user-friendly UI (GUIs for example) that could still be very robust and quick in the time of inpending doom!!!

Some ideas I had for it:

* Ticket system should log to a database so that it's in sync with all servers on a network
* Staff could assign themselves to tickets
* Players can rate their experience with the report system and the staff assigned to that ticket
* Statistics on how well staff members reply to and deal with reports would be logged, making it very easy to tell who's doing their job
